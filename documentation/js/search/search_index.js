Your job is to analyze the mood and style of the current song the user is listening to and suggest the most accurate next song that fits or enhances the user's mood and listening experience.\n\nGiven the current song details:\n${formatField('Name', currentSong.name)}${formatField('Type', currentSong.type)}${formatField('Year', currentSong.year)}${formatField('Duration', currentSong.duration)}${formatField('Label', currentSong.label)}${formatField('Language', currentSong.language)}${formatField('Copyright', currentSong.copyright)}${formatField('Album Name', albumName)}${formatField('Artist Name', artistsName)}${formatField('Is User Liked', currentSong.isLiked)}\n\n🎯 Responsibilities:\n- Analyze the mood and style of the current song based on the given details (name, album name, language, artist, year, etc.).\n- Consider whether the user liked the song or not to suggest the next song accordingly. If the user liked the song, recommend something similar or enhancing the mood; if not, suggest a song that may better fit the user's preferences.\n- Suggest the next song that is the most accurate match in mood, vibe, and style to provide a smooth and positive user experience.\n- Use only the current song’s metadata to infer the best next song.\n- Do not include any additional text, explanation, or formatting in your response.\n- Do not repeat the already suggested song.\n\nProvide only the JSON object and no extra text, no formatting:\n{\n  \"songName\": \"string\",\n  \"artistsName\": \"string\"\n}\n\n`;\n\n    this.history.push({ role: 'user', parts: [{ text: prompt }] });\n    const headers = new HttpHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n    const

(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

expenses. The application emphasizes a user-friendly UI/UX tailored specifically for smartphones, allowing seamless personal finance management on the go.\nThis application leverages Angular as the frontend framework and Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI styling. All user data is stored in LocalStorage, making the app lightweight and independent of backend dependencies.\n\n🧰 Tech Stack\n\n\n\nTechnology\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nAngular\nFrontend application logic\n\n\nTailwind CSS\nStyling and responsive UI\n\n\nLocalStorage\nPersistent data storage\n\n\nDjango\nBackend api logic\n\n\n\n\n📱 Features & Functionality\n1. Dashboard View\n\nUpon launch, users are greeted with two interactive graphs:\n\nExpense Graph (Toggle: Monthly / Daily / Yearly): Displays a line graph representing user expenses over time.

Calendar View\n\nUsers can view a monthly calendar to explore expenses on specific dates.\nTap any date to open a popup modal displaying all expenses for that day.\nNavigate across months and years to view past or future expenses.\nToggle the Show HeatMap switch to highlight each day based on spending intensity.\nDays are color-coded based on spending thresholds (e.g. No expense,  threshold) for quick insights.\nUsers can now customize the threshold amounts for each heatmap color:\nRed (Rose) – default  > ₹1000\nYellow (Amber) – default ₹500 - 1000\nGreen (Emerald) – default \n\n\nA summary table displays each color, the number of days, the total expense, and an Edit button for updating the thresholds.\nEditing allows users to set a new amount for the corresponding color, immediately updating the heatmap visualization.\n\n\nAdditionally, users can enable a radio option to automatically set threshold values based on their budget, where\nRose represents the average spent per day amount.\nEmerald represents the suggested spending per day amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. List View\n\nDisplays all user expenses in a scrollable, and sortable list.\n\nUsers can:\n\n🔍 Search expenses quickly by typing keywords (category, note, or payment mode).\n🧾 Sort expenses by date, amount, or category.\n🎯 Filter by category, date, extra spending, and payment mode.\n🖱️ Tap any entry to open a modal with complete details and options to edit or delete the expense.\n\n\n\n\n5.
