(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:
